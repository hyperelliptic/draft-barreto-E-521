Abstract

   This document describes the curve E-521 and its use for internet
   protocols.  It specifies the wire format for ECDH (Elliptic-curve
   Diffie-Hellman) key-agreement as well as the key agreement
   computations.  It also specifies the wire format and computations for
   an elliptic-curve signature scheme.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the curve E-521 and its use for internet
   protocols.  It specifies the wire format for ECDH (Elliptic-curve
   Diffie-Hellman) key-agreement as well as the key agreement
   computations.  It also specifies the wire format and computations for
   an elliptic-curve signature scheme.

   This provides a stable reference for the curve E-521.  This curve was
   found independently by three teams: Michael Hamburg Daniel J.
   Bernstein and Tanja Lange Diego F.  Aranha and Paulo S.  L.  M.
   Barreto and Geovandro C.  C.  F.  Pereira and Jefferson E.
   Ricardini, see [E521] in fall 2013 [SafeCurves].

   This curve has been proposed for use in Brazilian IT systems (see
   [BarretoAranha]) and benchmarking results are available
   [GrangerScott].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Notation and Definitions

   The following notation and definitions are used in this document
   (notation is to the left of the ":"):

   A: A value used in an elliptic-curve equation.

   B: A value used in an elliptic-curve equation.

   d: A value used in an elliptic-curve equation.

   E: An elliptic-curve.

   p: A prime.

   GF(p): The field with p elements.

   _#: Subscript notation, where # is a number or letter.

   =: Assignment.

   ^: Exponentiation.

   +, -, *, /: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division,
   respectively.

   Note that all operations are performed modulo p.

3.  The E-521 curve

   Let p = 2^521 - 1.  Let E-521 be the elliptic curve with equation in
   Edwards form x^2 + y^2 = 1 - 376014 * x^2 * y^2 over GF(p).  The
   Montgomery form of E-521 is given by B * y^2 = x^3 + A * x^2 + x over
   GF(p), where A = 2 * (1 - 376014)/(1 + 376014) and B = 4/(1 +
   376014).  The map from the Edwards curve takes a point (x,y) to the
   point ((1 + y)/(1 - y),(1 + y)/(1 - y) * x).  The map from the
   Montgomery curve takes a point (x,y) to the point (x/y, (x - 1)/(x +
   1)).

   Each element x of GF(p) has a unique little-endian representation as
   66 bytes x[0] ... x[65], such that x[0] + 256 * x[1] + 256^2 * x[2] +
   ... + 256^65 * x[65] is congruent to x modulo p, and x[65] is
   minimal.  Implementations MUST only produce field elements in this
   form.

4.  Security considerations

   The field is chosen as the field with around 512 bits that offers the
   fastest field arithmetic.  Reduction modulo p = 2^521 - 1 is
   particularly efficient because p is a Mersenne prime.  The value for
   d is the smallest in absolute value so that d is not a square, #E and
   #E' (the twist of E) have both cofactor 4, and E satisfies the
   remaining criteria for a safe curve.  See also [SafeCurves].
